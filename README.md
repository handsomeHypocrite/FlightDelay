# FlightDelay

Pulling delay time of flight from data.
Flight_Delay.csv
The aggregate rolling average within 7 days.
Moving_Average_Delay.csv

Data obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data


Note:
1. Delay time was taken straight from data, because arrival and scheduled_arrival information has only time but not date. And some delay can can get up to 36 hours. Making it very difficult to determin exact delay time from other infomation.
